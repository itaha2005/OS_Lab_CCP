## Experiment / CCP Title
Complex Computing Problem (CCP)

---

## Objective
The objective of this experiment is to understand and implement the
Complex Computing Problem using multithreading concepts in C++.
The experiment demonstrates how synchronization mechanisms are used
to prevent race conditions when multiple threads access shared resources.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Language: C++
- Compiler: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- IDE: VMware Workstation / Oracle Virtual Box
- Operating System: Linux 

---

## Concepts Covered
- Process vs Thread
- Multithreading
- Scheduling 
- Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
- Semaphore
- Synchronization
- Deadlock (basic understanding)

---

## Description
In this CCP, multiple threads are created that try to access a shared
resource. Without synchronization, inconsistent results may occur due
to race conditions. To solve this issue, synchronization techniques such
as mutex and semaphore are applied to ensure that only one thread enters
the critical section at a time.
